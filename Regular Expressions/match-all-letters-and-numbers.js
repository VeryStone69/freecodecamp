//===== Match All Letters and Numbers
// Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with [a-z]. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.

// The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is \w. This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (_).

// These shortcut character classes are also known as shorthand character classes.

//===== Exercise
// Use the shorthand character class \w to count the number of alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.

//===== My solution
let quoteSample = "The five boxing wizards jump quickly.";
let alphabetRegexV2 = /\w/gi;
let result = quoteSample.match(alphabetRegexV2).length;

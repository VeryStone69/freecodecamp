this repository is used to practice working with github. I'll be committing tasks from freecodecamp, which can be very primitive or quite complex.

<ul>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic CSS</h3>
  <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and many other aspects of HTML elements. Now that you've described the structure of your cat photo app, give it some style with CSS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic HTML and HTML5</h3>
  <p>HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item. In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements â€” the building blocks of any webpage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic JavaScript</h3>
  <p>JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers. In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>ES6</h3>
  <p>ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable. Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year. ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
  <p>Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches. In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.</p>

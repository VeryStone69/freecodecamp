this repository is used to practice working with github. I'll be committing tasks from freecodecamp, which can be very primitive or quite complex.

<h2>Directory contains:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic CSS</h3>
  <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and many other aspects of HTML elements. Now that you've described the structure of your cat photo app, give it some style with CSS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic HTML and HTML5</h3>
  <p>HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item. In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements — the building blocks of any webpage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Applied Visual Design</h3>
  <p>Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver your unique message.
In this course, you'll learn how to apply these different elements of visual design to your webpages.</p>
  </li>
   <li>
  <h3>Applied Accessibility</h3>
  <p>In web development, accessibility refers to web content and a UI (user interface) that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. In this course, you'll learn best practices for building webpages that are accessible to everyone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic JavaScript</h3>
  <p>JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers. In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>ES6</h3>
  <p>ECMAScript, or ES, is a standardized version of JavaScript. Because all major browsers follow this specification, the terms ECMAScript and JavaScript are interchangeable. Most of the JavaScript you've learned up to this point was in ES5 (ECMAScript 5), which was finalized in 2009. While you can still write programs in ES5, JavaScript is constantly evolving, and new features are released every year. ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language. In this course, you'll learn these new features, including arrow functions, destructuring, classes, promises, and modules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
  <p>Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches. In this course, you'll learn how to use special characters, capture groups, positive and negative lookaheads, and other techniques to match any text you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Debugging</h3>
  <p>Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them. Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended. In this course, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript console to debug programs and prevent common issues before they happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic Data Structures</h3>
  <p>Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures — arrays and objects. In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <h3>Basic Algorithm Scripting</h3>
  <p>An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.
In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.</p>
  </li>

===== Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag
This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

====== Exercise
The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the a tag, the color is blue.
